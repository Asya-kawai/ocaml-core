(* The following [sexp_of_X] functions ignore their argument and return [Sexp.Atom "_"].
   They are useful when one has a polymorphic type ['a t] with a sexp converter [val
   sexp_of_t : ('a -> Sexp.t) -> 'a t -> Sexp.t], and one wants to convert a value of type
   ['a t] to a sexp, yet one doesn't have a sexp_converter for ['a] handy.  These
   functions allow one to use [<:sexp_of< a t >>] to get a sexp converter for ['a t].  For
   example:q

   let f (type a) a_t = ... (<:sexp_of< a t >> a_t) ...

   It is useful to have a variety of such functions for situations when one needs to
   choose an abstract type name other than [a], possibly because there are multiple
   abstract types around simultaneously.  For example:

   let f (type a) a_t (type b) b_t = ... (<:sexp_of< a t * b t >> (a_t, b_t)) ... *)
val sexp_of_a  : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_a1 : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_a2 : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_a3 : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_a4 : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_a5 : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_b  : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_c  : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_d  : _ -> Sexp.t
val sexp_of_e  : _ -> Sexp.t

(* [with_return f] allows for something like the return statement in C within [f].  There
   are three ways [f] can terminate:

   1. If [f] calls [r.return x], then [x] is returned by [with_return].
   2. If [f] evaluates to a value [x], then [x] is returned by [with_return].
   3. If [f] raises an exception, it escapes [with_return].

   Here is a typical example:

   {[
   let find l ~f =
   with_return (fun r ->
   List.iter l ~f:(fun x -> if f x then r.return (Some x));
   None)
   ]}

   It is only because of a deficiency of ML types that [with_return] doesn't have type:

   {[ val with_return : 'a. (('a -> ('b. 'b)) -> 'a) -> 'a ]}

   but we can slightly increase the scope of 'b, without changing the meaning of the type
   and then we get
   type 'a return = { return : 'b . 'a -> b }
   val with_return : ('a return -> 'a) -> 'a

   But the actual reason we chose to use a record type with polymorphic field is that
   otherwise we would have to clobber the namespace of functions with [return] and that is
   undesirable because [return] would get hidden as soon as we open any monad. We
   considered names different than [return] but everything seemed worse than just having
   [return] as a record field. We are clobbering the namespace of record fields but that
   is much more acceptable.

   [equal] function for a specific type, or use (=) or (<>) for built in types
   like char, int, float, ...
